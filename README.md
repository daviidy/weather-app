# weather-app
The goal of this project is to build a weather app with webpack, ES6 modules, and API.

- I wrote the functions that hit the API. Functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location.
- Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and fetch the weather info
- Styled the page using bootstrap 4
